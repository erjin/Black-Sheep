Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in t.

Example:

Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added



Idea: 

1. 用xor 去diff char 就像 encryption decryption

2. 用 ascii code 转成数字 算出sum 然后 减出来的那个数字就是char

class Solution {
public:
    char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
        char a = 0;
        
        for(char c: s){
            a ^= c;
        }
        
        for(char c: t){
            a ^= c;
        }
        
        return a; 
        
    }
};.
